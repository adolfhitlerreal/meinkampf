                "After years of uninterrupted labour it was now possible for the first time to begin a work for which many had asked",
                "I therefore decided to devote two volumes to a description not only of the aims of our Movement, but also of its development. ",
                "There is more to be learned from this than from any purely doctrinaire treatise.",
                "This has also given me the opportunity of describing my own development in so far ",

                "In this work I turn not to strangers, but to those followers of the Movement",
                "whose hearts belong to it and who wish to study it more profoundly. ",
                "I know that fewer people are won over by the written, than by the spoken word",
                "and that every great movement on this earth owes its growth to great speakers and not to great writers. ",
                "Nevertheless, in order to achieve more equality and uniformity in the defence of any doctrine, ",
                "its fundamental principles must be committed to writing.",
                "May these two volumes therefore serve as building stones which I contribute to the common task. ",

                "To-day I consider it a good omen that Destiny appointed Braunau-on-the-Inn to be my birthplace, ",
                "for that little town is situated just on the frontier between those two German States, ",
                "the reunion of which seems, at least to us of the younger generation, a task to which we should devote our lives, ",

                "it still ought to take place. People of the same blood should be in the same Reich. ",

                "When the territory of the Reich embraces all Germans and proves incapable of assuring them a livelihood, only then can the moral right arise, ",
                "from the need of the people, to acquire foreign territory. The plough is then the sword, ",

                "but in another respect it teaches us a lesson that is applicable to our day. ",
                "Over a hundred years ago this sequestered spot was the scene of a tragic calamity which affected the whole German nation and will he remembered for ever, ",
