                "On April 1st, 1924, I began to serve my sentence of detention in the Fortress of Landsberg am Lech, ",
                "following the verdict pronounced by the Munich People’s Court on that day. ",
                "After years of uninterrupted labour it was now possible for the first time to begin a work for which many had asked",
                "I therefore decided to devote two volumes to a description not only of the aims of our Movement, but also of its development. ",
                "There is more to be learned from this than from any purely doctrinaire treatise.",
                "This has also given me the opportunity of describing my own development in so far ",
                "as such a description is necessary to the understanding of the first as well as of the second volume and to refute the unfounded tales",
                "which the Jeewwish press has circulated about me. ",
                "In this work I turn not to strangers, but to those followers of the Movement",
                "whose hearts belong to it and who wish to study it more profoundly. ",
                "I know that fewer people are won over by the written, than by the spoken word",
                "and that every great movement on this earth owes its growth to great speakers and not to great writers. ",
                "Nevertheless, in order to achieve more equality and uniformity in the defence of any doctrine, ",
                "its fundamental principles must be committed to writing.",
                "May these two volumes therefore serve as building stones which I contribute to the common task. ",
                "At half-past twelve on the afternoon of November 9th, 1923, those whose names are given below fell in front of the Feldherrnhalle ",

                "To-day I consider it a good omen that Destiny appointed Braunau-on-the-Inn to be my birthplace, ",
                "for that little town is situated just on the frontier between those two German States, ",
                "the reunion of which seems, at least to us of the younger generation, a task to which we should devote our lives, ",
                "and in the pursuit of which every possible means should be employed.",
                "German-Austria must be restored to the great German Fatherland, and not on economic grounds. ",
                "Even if the union were a matter of economic indifference, and even if it were to be disadvantageous from the economic standpoint, ",
                "it still ought to take place. People of the same blood should be in the same Reich. ",
                "The German people will have no right to engage in a colonial policy until they have brought all their children together in one State. ",
                "When the territory of the Reich embraces all Germans and proves incapable of assuring them a livelihood, only then can the moral right arise, ",
                "from the need of the people, to acquire foreign territory. The plough is then the sword, ",
                "and the tears of war will produce the daily bread for the generations to come. ",
                "For this reason the little frontier town appeared to me as the symbol of a great task, ",
                "but in another respect it teaches us a lesson that is applicable to our day. ",
                "Over a hundred years ago this sequestered spot was the scene of a tragic calamity which affected the whole German nation and will he remembered for ever, ",
                "at least in the an nals of German history. ",
                "At the time of our Fatherland’s deepest humiliation, a Nurnberg bookseller, ",
                "Johannes Palm, an uncompromising nationalist and an enemy of the French, was put to death here because he had loved Germany even in her misfortune. ",
                "He obstinately refused to disclose the names of his associates, or rather the principals who were chiefly responsible for the affair, just as Leo SchIageter did. ",
                "The former, like the latter, was denounced to the French by a government official, ",
                "a director of police from Augsburg who won ignoble renown on that occasion ",
                "and set the example which was to be copied at a later date by the German officials of the Reich under Herr Severing’s regime. ",
                "In this little town on the Inn, hallowed by the memory of a German martyr a town that was Bavarian by blood but under the rule of the Austrian State, ",
                "a town that was Bavarian by blood but under the rule of the Austrian State, ",
                "my parents were domiciled towards the end of the last century. My father was a civil servant who fulfilled his duties very conscientiously. ",
                "My mother looked after the household and lovingly devoted herself to the care of her children of that period I have not retained many memories, ",
                "because after a few years my father had to leave that frontier town which I had come to love so much ",
                "and take up a new post farther down the Inn valley, at Passau, therefore, actually in Germany itself: ",
                "In those days it was the usual lot of an Austrian civil servant to be transferred periodically from one post to another. ",
                "Not long after coming to Passau my father was transferred to Linz, ",
                "and while there he retired to live on his pension, but this did not mean that the old gentleman would now rest from his labours. ",
                "He was the son of a poor cottager, and while still a boy he grew restless and left home. ",
                "When he was barely thirteen years old he buckled on his satchel and set forth from his native country parish. ",
                "Despite the dissuasion of villagers who could speak from ‘experience’, he went to Vienna to learn a trade there. ",
                "This was in the fifties of last century. ",
                "It was a sore trial, that of deciding to leave home and face the unknown, ",
                "with three gulden in his pocket but when the boy of thirteen was a lad of seventeen and had passed his apprenticeship examination as a craftsman, ",
                "he was not content. On the contrary, the persistent economic depression of that period ",
                "and the constant want and misery strengthened his resolution to give up working at a trade and strive for ‘something higher.’",
                "As a boy it had seemed to him that the position of the parish priest in his native village was the highest in the scale of human attainment, ",
                "but now that the big city had enlarged his outlook, the young man looked up to the dignity of a state official as the highest of all. ",
                "With the tenacity of one whom misery and trouble had already made old when only half-way through his youth, ",
                "the young man of seventeen obstinately set out on his new project and stuck to it until he won through. ",
                "He became a civil servant. He was about twenty-three years old, I think, when he succeeded in making himself what he had resolved to become. ",
                "Thus he was able to keep, the vow he had made as a poor boy, ",
                "not to return to his native village until he was ‘somebody.’ He had gained his end, ",
                "but in the village there was nobody who remembered him as a little boy, and the village itself had become strange to him. ",
                "Now at last, when he was fifty-six years old, he gave up his active career, but he could not bear to be idle for a single day. ",
                "On the outskirts of the small market-town of Lambach in Upper Austria he bought a farm and tilled it himself. ",
                "Thus, at the end of a long and hard-working career, he returned to the life which his father had led. ",
                "It was at this period that I first began to have ideals of my own. ",
                "I spent a good deal of time scampering about in the open, on the long road from school, ",
                "and mixing with some of the roughest of the boys, which caused my mother many anxious moments. ",
                "All this tended to make me something quite the reverse of a stay-at-home. ",
                "I gave scarcely any serious thought to the question of choosing a vocation in life, ",
                "but I was certainly quite out of sympathy with the kind of career which my father had followed. ",
                "I think that an inborn talent for speaking now began to develop and take shape during the more or less strenuous arguments which I used to have with my comrades. ",
                "I had become a juvenile ringleader who learned well and easily at school, but was rather difficult to manage. ",
                "In my free time I practised singing in the choir of the monastery church at Lambach, ",
                "and thus it happened that I was placed in a very favourable position to be emotionally impressed again and again",
                "by the magnificent splendour of eccIesiastical ceremonial. ",
                "What could be more natural for me than to look upon the abbot as representing the highest human ideal worth striving for, ",
                "just as the position of the humble village priest had appeared so to my father in his own boyhood days? ",
                "At least that was my idea for a while, but the childish disputes I had with my father did not lead him to appreciate his son’s oratorical gifts in such a way",
                "as to see in them a favourable promise for such a career, and so he naturally could not understand the boyish ideas I had in my head at that time. ",
                "This contradiction in my character made him feel somewhat anxious. ",
                "As a matter of fact, that transitory yearning after such a vocation soon gave way to hopes that were better suited to my temperament. ",
                "Browsing among my father’s books, I chanced to come across some publications that dealt with military subjects. ",
                "One of these publications was a popular history of the Franco-German War of 1870-71. ",
                "It consisted of two volumes of art illustrated periodical dating from those years. These became my favourite reading. ",
                "In a little while that great and heroic conflict began to occupy my mind, ",
                "and from that time onwards I became more and more enthusiastic about everything that was in any way connected with war or military affairs. ",
                "The story of the Franco-German War had a special significance for me on other grounds also. ",
                "For the first time, and as yet only in quite a vague way, the question began to present itself: ",
                "Is there a difference—and if there be, what is it—between the Germans who fought that war, and the other Germans? ",
                "Why did not Austria also take part in it? Why did not my father and all the others fight in that struggle?",
                "Are we not the same as the other Germans? Do we not all belong together? ",
                "That was the fiat time that this problem began to agitate my small brain, and from the replies that were given to the questions which I asked very tentatively, ",
                "I was forced to accept the fact, though with a secret envy, that not all Germans had the good luck to belong to Bismarck’s Reich. ",
                "This was something that I could not understand. ",
                "It was decided that I should study. Considering my character as a whole, and especially my temperament, ",
                "my father decided that the classical subjects studied at the Gymnasium were not suited to my natural talents, ",
                "lie thought that the Realschule would suit me better. ",
                "My obvious talent for drawing confirmed him in that view, for in his opinion, drawing was a subject too much neglected in the Austrian Gymnasium. ",
                "Probably also the memory of the hard road which he himself had travelled contributed to make him look upon classical studies as unpractical",
                "and accordingly to set little value on them. ",
                "At the back of his mind he had the idea that his son should also become a government official. Indeed he had decided on that career for me. ",
                "The difficulties with which he had had to contend in making his own career led him to overestimate what he had achieved, ",
                "because this was exclusively the result of his own indefatigable industry and energy. ",
                "The characteristic pride of the self-made man caused him to cherish the idea that his son should follow the same calling and if possible"
                "rise to a higher position in it. ",
                "Moreover, this idea was strengthened by the consideration that the results of his own life’s industry ",
                "had placed him in a position to facilitate his son’s advancement in the same profession. ",
